                                <p>Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other garment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury by blunt impacts, electrical hazards, heat, chemicals, and infection, for job-related occupational safety and health purposes, and in sports, martial arts, combat, etc.</p>
                                <p>To protect anyone from danger by working any electrical activities, protective equipment such as safety shoes, goggles, hard hats, and gloves are issued. The use of this equipment is mandatory on certain activity. Their use is a MUST, and there is no question about that. Be sure to USE THEM on any designated activity WHERE they are REQUIRED. They can protect you from a lot of harm.</p>
                                <p><strong>Importance of Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The type of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed when using hand tools depends on the nature of the task. At a minimum, eye protection should always be worn.</li>
                                    <li>The use of hand protection may also be appropriate to provide protection against cuts, abrasion, and repeated impact.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce exposure to hazards</p>
                                <p><strong>Categories of Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Eye and Face Protection</strong> This will be used to avoid being exposed to a large number of hazards that pose danger to their eyes and face. Then to ensure that workers have appropriate eye or face protection if they are exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"><li>Safety spectacles. These protective eyeglasses have safety frames constructed of metal or plastic and impact-resistant lenses. Side shields are available on some models.</li>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"><li>Goggles. These are tight-fitting eye protection that completely cover the eyes, eye sockets and the facial area immediately surrounding the eyes and provide protection from impact, dust and splashes. Some goggles will fit over corrective lenses.</li>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img">><li>Face shields. These shields protect against nuisance dusts and potential splashes or sprays of hazardous liquids but will not provide adequate protection against impact hazards. Face shields used in combination with goggles or safety spectacles will provide additional protection against impact hazards.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Foot and Leg Protection</strong> Used for possible foot or leg injuries from the Moist floors, Non-grounded Power Extension cables and Power Surge that you might get a serious injuries.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Safety shoes Safety shoes to be used electrically conductive to prevent the buildup of static electricity in areas with the potential for explosive atmospheres or nonconductive to protect workers from workplace electrical hazards.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Hand and Arm Protection</strong> - If a workplace hazard assessment reveals that workers face potential injury to hands and arms that cannot be eliminated through work activity and  practice controls. Working Gloves with a plastic rubber is one of the examples of Hand and Arm Protection Equipment‟s that usually used in any electrical working activities.</p>
                                <p><strong>Body Protection</strong>  This is used to protect possible bodily injury in the work place, workers must wear appropriate body protection while performing their jobs. In addition to cuts and radiation and avoid some electrical charges leaks that cannot be eliminated.</p>
                                <p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment includes:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Safety Precautions</li>

                                <p><strong>Safety precautions</strong></p>
                                <p>Proper preparation is the key to a successful built. Before you begin, make sure that you have the tool you will need, and secure a clear well-lit workplace. Gather all the components you‟ll be using and unpack them at the same time. Find a dry, well-ventilated place to do your work, you should choose an area without carpets, because it tends to create static electricity. Always keep in mind that personal protection is one of the traits of a good technician.</p>
                                <p><strong>Preventive Maintenance</strong></p>
                                <p>Maintenance is keeping something in working order. It includes repair, testing, adjusting, and replacing parts of a computer or a peripheral.</p>
                                <p><strong>Anti-Static Devices</strong> - These are the devices used to protect computer units from electro static discharge.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"> <li><strong>Anti-static Wrist Strap</strong>  or ESD wrist strap, or ground bracelet is an antistatic device used to safely ground a person working on very sensitive electronic equipment, to prevent the buildup of static electricity on their body, which can result in electrostatic discharge (ESD).</li>
                                   <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"> <li><strong>Anti-static Mat</strong> - An antistatic floor mat or ground mat is one of a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding.</li>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"> <li><strong>Anti-static Bag</strong> - is a bag used for shipping (usually electronic) components, which are prone to damage caused by electrostatic discharge.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>An electrostatic-sensitive device (ESD) is any component which can be damaged by common static charges which build up on people, tools, and other non-conductors or semiconductors. ESD commonly also stands for electrostatic discharge. As electronic parts like computer central processing units (CPUs) become packed more and more densely with transistors the transistors shrink and become more and more vulnerable to ESD.</p>
                                <p><strong>Power Surge Protector Devices</strong> - is designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or by shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"> <li><strong>Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR)</strong> - is designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage level. A voltage regulator may be a simple "feed-forward" design or may include negative feedback control loops. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.</li>
                                    <img src="" alt="" class="side-img"> <li><strong>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</strong> - is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source, typically mains power, fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, super capacitors, or flywheels. The on-battery runtime of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment. A UPS is typically used to protect hardware such as computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious business disruption or data loss.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Central Processing Unit</strong></p>
                                        <p>The central processing unit (CPU), sometimes called the processor, is considered the computer's brain. Most calculations take place in the CPU, making it the most important element of a computer system. CPUs come in different form factors, each requiring a particular slot or socket on the motherboard. Common CPU manufacturers include Intel and AMD.</p>
                                        <p>The CPU socket or slot serves as the interface between the motherboard and the processor. Most CPU sockets and processors in use today are built around the pin grid array (PGA) architecture. Slot-based processors are cartridge-shaped and fit into a slot similar to an expansion slot.</p>
                                        <p>Some CPUs incorporate hyper-threading to enhance performance. With hyper-threading, the CPU has multiple pieces of code being executed simultaneously on each pipeline, appearing to the operating system as two CPUs.</p>
                                        <p>A CPU's power is measured by its speed and the amount of data it can process. Speed is rated in cycles per second, measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). The amount of data a CPU can process at one time depends on the size of the processor data bus. Current processors have a 32-bit or 64-bit processor data bus.</p>
                                        <p>MMX is a set of multimedia instructions built into Intel processors, enabling them to handle common multimedia operations. However, only software specifically written to call MMX instructions can take advantage of the MMX instruction set.</p>
                                        <p>The latest processor technology incorporates more than one CPU core into a single chip. Many CPUs can process multiple instructions concurrently:</p>
                                            <ul>

                                                <li>Dual-core CPU: Two cores inside a single CPU chip, processing information simultaneously.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                    </li>

                                        <p><strong>Cooling System</strong> - Electronic components generate heat. Heat is caused by the flow of current within the components. Computer components perform better when kept cool. If the heat is not removed, the computer may run slower. If too much heat builds up, computer components can be damaged. Increasing the air flow in the computer case allows more heat to be removed. </p> 
                                            <p>A case fan is installed in the computer case to make the cooling process more efficient</p>
