                            <p><strong>Introduction to Computer Networks</strong></p>
                                <p>A node can be a device that is capable of sending or receiving data generated by 
                                    other nodes on the network like a computer, printer, etc. These links connecting the devices 
                                    are called Communication channels.
                                    </p>
                                <p>A network must be able to meet specific criteria’s; these are mentioned below:
                                    </p> 
                                <li>Performance </li>
                                <li>Reliability </li>
                                <li>Scalability</li>
                                <p><strong>Computer Networks: Performance</strong><p>
                                    It can be measured in the following ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Transit time: It is the time taken to travel a message from one device to another.</li>
                                    <li>Response time: It is defined as the time elapsed between inquiry and response.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Other ways to measure performance are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Efficiency of software</li>
                                    <li>Number of users</li>
                                    <li>Capability of connected hardware</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                                <p><strong>Computer Networks: Reliability</strong><br>
                                    It decides the frequency at which network failure takes place. The more the shortcomings are, the less is the network’s reliability.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Computer Networks: Security</strong><br>
                                    It refers to the protection of data from any unauthorized user or access. While traveling through a network, data passes many layers of a network, and data can be traced if attempted. Hence security is also an essential characteristic for Networks.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Properties of a Good Network</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Interpersonal Communication: We can communicate with each other efficiently and smoothly. Example: e-mails, chat rooms, video conferencing, etc., all of these are possible because of computer networks.</li>
                                    <li>Resources can be shared: We can share physical resources by making them available on a network such as printers, scanners, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Sharing files, data: Authorized users are allowed to share the files on the network.</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                                <p><strong>Data Communication</strong></p>
                                <p>The exchange of data between two devices through a transmission medium is called Data Communication.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Data Communication: Local</strong><br>
                                    Local communication takes place when the communicating devices are in the same geographical area, the same building, or face-to-face, etc.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Data Communication: Remote</strong><br>
                                    Remote communication takes place over a distance i.e. the devices are farther. The effectiveness of data communication can be measured through the following features:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Delivery: Delivery should be done to the correct destination.</li>
                                    <li>Timeliness: Delivery should be on time.</li>
                                    <li>Accuracy: Data delivered should be accurate.</li>
                                </ul>
                            
                                <p><strong>Components of Data Communication</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Message: It is the information to be delivered.</li>
                                    <li>Sender: Sender is the person who is sending the message.</li>
                                    <li>Receiver: Receiver is the person to whom the message is being sent to.</li>
                                    <li>Medium: It is the medium through which the message is sent. For example: A Modem.</li>
                                    <li>Protocol: These are some set of rules which govern data communication.</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                                <p><strong>Basic Communication Model</strong></p>
                                <p>A Communication model is used to exchange data between two parties.</p>
                                <p>Example communication between a computer, server, and telephone (through Modem).</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Source - Data to be transmitted is generated by this device, for example: telephones, personal computers, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Transmitter - The data generated by the source system is not directly transmitted in the form it created. The transmitter transforms and encodes the data in such a way to produce electromagnetic waves or signals.</li>
                                    <li>Transmission system can be a single transmission line or a complex network connecting source and destination.</li>
                                    <li>Receiver accepts the signal from the transmission system and converts it into a form that is easily managed by the destination device.</li>
                                    <li>Destination receives the incoming data from the receiver.</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                                <p><strong>Business Applications of Computer Networks</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Resource Sharing: The goal is to make all programs, equipment (like printers, etc.), and especially data, available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the resource and the user.</li>
                                    <li>Server-Client model: One can imagine a company’s information system consisting of one or more databases and some employees who need to access it remotely. In this model, the data is stored on powerful computers called Servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system administrator. In contrast, the employees have simple machines, called Clients, on their desks, using which they access remote data.</li>
                                    <li>Communication Medium: A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually every company that has two or more computers now has e-mail (electronic mail), which employees generally use for a great deal of daily communication.</li>
                                    <li>e-commerce: A goal that is starting to become more critical in businesses is doing business with consumers over the Internet. Airlines, bookstores, and music vendors have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shopping from home. This sector is expected to grow quickly in the future.</li>
                                </ol>   
                        <p><b>There are two ways to connect the devices:</b></p>
                                     <p><b>Point to Point Connection</b> - It is a protocol that is used as a
                                    communication link between two devices. It is simple to establish. The most common example for Point-to-Point connection (PPP) is a computer connected by telephone line.
                                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/M66xg5n.jpg" alt="point connection" class="centered-image">
                                    <br>We can connect the two devices using a pair of wires or using a microwave or satellite link. Example: Point-to-Point connection between the remote control and Television for changing the channels </p>
                                   
                                    <p><b>Multipoint Connection </b> - It is also called a Multidrop configuration. In this connection, two or more devices share a single link. There are two kinds of Multipoint Connections:
                                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tWMr9Vj.jpg" alt="multi point" class="centered-image">
                                        <br> If the links are used simultaneously between many devices, then it is a spatially shared line configuration. If the user takes turns while using the link, then it is time-shared (temporal) line configuration.
                                    </p>

                        <p>A network is a group of interconnected computers, linked for the purpose of sharing files, programs, and peripherals. Through your computers or office network, you can run programs, use printers, and edit files from other computers as if they were located on your own.  </p>
                        <p>A server is the computer on the network that manages the network resources, such as the shared files, programs, and printers.</p>
                        <p>Local-area network (LAN) is a computer network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or group of buildings e.g. a school.</p>
                        <p>The majority of networking, particularly at the corporate level, is done using the internet standard. At the center of the basic diagram of a wired network is either a hub or a switcher and computers are connected to the hub, much like spokes of a wheel or star. Each connection at the hub is called a port.</p>
                <p><strong>Three Basic Network Categories:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN):</strong> the smallest of the three network types, consists of PCs connected together within a limited area, such as within the same building, floor, or department.</li>
                            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GECJ8Cz.gif" alt="network" class="centered-image">
                            <li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</strong> a network that spans no more than 50 miles, designed to connect LANs spanning a town or city.</li>

                <p><strong>The Basic Rule:</strong></p>
                    <p>The basic rule for network design is known as the 5-4-3 rule. It states that in a 10 Mbps Ethernet network:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>You can have a maximum of five cable segments between any two computers</li>
                    <li>You can have a maximum of four repeaters (hubs, switches, wireless access points, etc.) between any two computers of the five cable segments (maximum) between any computers, only three of these can terminate in computers.</li>

                <p>Inside the cable, there are 8 color coded wires. These wires are twisted into 4 pairs of wires, each pair has a common color theme. One wire in the pair being a solid or primarily solid colored wire and the other being a primarily white wire with a colored stripe (Sometimes cable doesn't have any color on the striped cable, the only way to tell is to check which other wire it is twisted around).</p>

            <h4><strong> IDENTIFYING NETWORK MATERIALS </strong></h4>
                <p><strong>What Twisted Pair Is Like and Its Cabling Standards</strong></p>
                <p>Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors (usually copper) of a single circuit are twisted together. Why are the pairs twisted together? Because the two wires are carrying equal and opposite signals, one pair can induce crosstalk in another and the effect gets stronger along the length of the cable, which is bad for the transmission of signal. Twisting the pairs reduce the crosstalk between lines. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable</p>
            
                <p><strong>Shielded Twisted Pair vs. Unshielded Twisted Pair</strong></p>
                <p>Twisted pair cables are often shielded in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Twisted pair with shielding are known as shielded twisted pair (STP). In contrast to STP, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is not surrounded by any shielding.</p>
                <p>STP cable is also divided by overall shield and individual shield. Individual shielded twisted pair is with aluminum foil for each twisted pair or quad. This type of shielding protects cable from external electromagnetic interference (EMI) entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk. Overall shielded twisted pair is with overall foil or braided shield across all of the pairs within the 100 Ω twisted pair cable. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable. One STP cable can have both overall and individual shielding.</p>
                
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DXFj2eu.jpeg" alt="shielded twisted pair" class="centered-image">
               
                <p>UTP cable without shielding is more prone to outside interference. For this reason, this cable type is more often found in indoor telephone applications. Outdoor telephone cables contain hundreds or thousands pairs. Pairs that have the same twisted rate within the cable can experience some degree of crosstalk, so wire pairs are usually selected carefully within a large cable to reduce the crosstalk.</p>
            
                <p>Most UTP cable uses RJ45 connectors, which look like telephone connectors (RJ11) but have eight wires instead of four.</p>

                <p><strong> Twisted Pair Cabling: T568A or T568B? </strong></p>
                <p>Two wiring standards are commonly used with twisted pair cabling: T568A and T568B. These are telecommunications standards from TIA and EIA that specify the pin arrangements for the connectors (often RJ45) on UTP or STP cables. The number 568 refers to the order in which the wires within the twisted pair cable are terminated and attached to the connector. The signal is identical for both.</p>

                <p><strong>Coaxial Cable: Not Just a Video Cable </strong></p>
                <p>Coaxial cable is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. The inner conductor and the outer shield share a geometric axis. Many coaxial cable has an insulating outer sheath or jacket.</p>

                <p><strong>Widely Used Coaxial Connector Types </strong></p>
                <p>Many coaxial connector types are available in the audio, digital, video, RF and microwave industries, each designed for a specific purpose and application. One consideration the number of connect-disconnect cycles that a connector pair could withstand while still performing as expected. Here are some common coaxial connector types.</p>

                <p><strong>The Capable Optical Fiber Cable</strong></p>
                <p>Optical fiber cabling is an excellent transmission medium for its high data capacity and supported long distances. It is indispensable in any fiber optic network. It has a fiber/glass core within a rubber outer coating and uses beams of light rather than electrical signals to relay data. Because light doesn't diminish over distance the way electrical signals do, this cabling can run for distances measured in kilometers with transmission speeds from 10 Mbps up to 100 Gbps or higher.</p>

                    <p><strong> What is NIC?</strong></p>
                        <p>A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, installed on a computer so it can connect to a network. Modern NICs provide functionality to computers, such as support for input/output interrupt, direct-memory access interfaces, data transmission, network traffic engineering and partitioning. <br>
                             A NIC provides a computer with a dedicated, full-time connection to a network. It implements the physical layer circuitry necessary for communicating with a data link layer standard, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Each card represents a device and can prepare, transmit and control the flow of data on the network.
                            </p>
                            <p>Types of NICs</p>    
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Wireless.</b> NICs that use an antenna to provide wireless reception through radio frequency waves. Wi-Fi connections use wireless NICs </li> 
                                    <li><b>Wired.</b> NICs that have input jacks made for cables. Ethernet is the most popular wired LAN technology.</li>
                                    <li><b>USB.</b> NICs that provide network connections through a device plugged into the USB port.</li>
                                    <li><b>Fiber optics.</b> NICs used as a high-speed support system for network traffic handling on server computers. It's also possible to achieve this support by combining multiple NICs. Fiber optic NICs are typically more expensive and complex.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p><strong>Components of NICs include the following:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Speed.</b> All NICs have a speed rating in terms of megabits per second (Mbps) that determines the card's performance in a network. If the network's bandwidth is lower than the NIC or multiple computers connect with the same controller, the labeled speed decreases. The average Ethernet NICs come in 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps and 1 gigabits per second varieties.</li>
                                    <li><b>Driver.</b> The required software that passes data between the computer's operating system and the NIC. When a NIC is installed on a computer, the corresponding driver software is also downloaded. Drivers must stay updated and uncorrupted to ensure optimal performance from the NIC.</li>
                                    <li><b>MAC address.</b> Unique, unchangeable media access control addresses, also known as physical network addresses, are assigned to NICs. MAC addresses deliver Ethernet packets to the computer.</li>
                                    <li><b>LED indicator</b>. Most NICs have an LED indicator integrated into the connector to notify the user when the network connects and data transmission occurs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Router.</b> A router is sometimes needed to enable communication between a computer and other devices. In this case, the NIC connects to the router which is connected to the internet.</li>

From its root word route, it routes data from one network to another based on their IP address. Therefore, it is what you need for the data in your group’s network to be transmitted outside your local network and at the same time access the information superhighway, the internet. </p>   
                        <p><b> How does a router work?</b></p>
                            <p>When a router receives data packets from other networks, it inspects the data’s IP address. It then determines if the data is meant for its own network or for another network. When the router determines that the data is for its own network, it receives the data. If it determines that the data is not for its own network, it sends it off to another network. The router is then the gateway of your network. It serves as an entrance and exit of data in your network.</p>

                            <h4>SETTING UP CONNECTION USING ROUTER</h4>  
                            <P><strong>1.	Plug in the power cord of the router to the power source and turn it on. </strong></P>    
                            <p><strong>2.	Reset the router by pressing the reset button for at least 5 to 10 seconds.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>4.	Plug the other end of the UTP/LAN cable to any of the 4 Ethernet ports of the router. They all work the same way.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>5.	Plug the LAN cable from your router to the internet service provider port.
                                You are good to go with this setup. It is now time to configure the router.

                                    <p>The Windows Firewall is generally good enough for most users, but if you're using a third-party app, it will show up in the security providers settings. The advanced settings allow you to create inbound and outbound rules for network traffic.</p>
                                <p><strong>WINDOWS SECURITY AND FIREWALL</strong></p> 
                                <p> The Windows security app in Windows 10 includes a firewall and network protection feature, which is essential for protecting your computer from potential threats. The firewall should be turned on for all options, including domain, private, and public.</p>
    
                                   <p> The domain setting can be used to connect to a work account that has its own firewall. <br>
                                    The firewall for public networks is much tighter and restricts file and printer sharing, while the private network firewall only allows access to your own computers. You can also allow apps through the firewall by clicking on the option, which will bring up the Windows Defender panel in the control panel.</p>
    
                                    <p>It is important to choose the correct settings for private and public options. You can also create rules for new apps and allow them to connect automatically. The network and internet troubleshooter can help diagnose any issues with your network, and the firewall notification settings can be managed to receive notifications when Microsoft Defender Firewall blocks a new app.
